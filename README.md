# Poke App Frontend setup

### To run project:
1. Run `yarn install` to fetch dependencies
2. Run `yarn start`
3. Go to `localhost:3000` and see the application's frontend 

### Explore third party api:
Go to [poke api](https://pokeapi.co/) and estimate the number of pokemons available in order to have an idea of the current limits for randomly requesting a pokemon
```
TODO: Update number of pokemons available for new batches or set up a separate call that dynamically updates it
```

### Obs: Previous battles and win/losses stats will not be available if backend is not up, see [backend](https://github.com/dlgiant/poke_back)
